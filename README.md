# codat-nextjs-sample-project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and example requests from [Codat](https://docs.codat.io/docs).

## What is Codat?

Codat is the universal API for small business data. We provide real-time connectivity to enable software providers and financial institutions to build integrated products for their small business customers.

Small businesses run on many different platforms. Codat gives these platforms a standard way to connect with each other so they can move data around seamlessly at scale.

## Getting started

You'll need your API key first - read our guide to [getting authorized](https://docs.codat.io/reference/authentication).

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your API key.

## Running the project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
